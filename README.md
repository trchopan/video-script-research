# video-script-research

A simple helper tool for me to research about a particular project. Use Youtube as a content resource for the research.

Features:

- Use Vector database to find similarity meaning in the transcript from Youtube.
- General knowledge from Wikipedia
- Extends scripts by context in Scratch Pad
